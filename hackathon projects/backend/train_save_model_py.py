# Step 1: Load the Dataset
data = pd.read_csv("diabetes.csv")  # Ensure the dataset is in the same directory or provide the correct path

# Step 2: Split the Data into Features (X) and Target (y)
X = data.drop("Outcome", axis=1)  # Features (all columns except 'Outcome')
y = data["Outcome"]  # Target (the 'Outcome' column, indicating diabetes presence)

# Step 3: Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 4: Train the Model
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 5: Evaluate the Model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Step 6: Save the Model to a File
